# 🚀 ManageHack: The AI-Powered Hackathon Simulator  

### **Never been to a hackathon? Want to gain experience before jumping into a real competition?**  
**ManageHack** is an interactive **hackathon simulator** where you lead a team of **AI teammates**, each with **unique personalities, strengths, and quirks**. You'll navigate **realistic team dynamics, code challenges, and presentation hurdles**, all while honing your **problem-solving, coding, and teamwork skills** in a **fun, AI-driven experience**.

## 🎮 How It Works  

### 🏆 1. **Assemble Your AI Team**  
- Choose **5 AI teammates** from a **pool of 10**, each with distinct **personalities and abilities**.  
- Some AI are **great at coding but terrible at teamwork**, while others are **amazing presenters but struggle with technical tasks**.  
- **Your challenge: Build a well-balanced team to succeed!**  

### ⚡ 2. **Manage Team Dynamics & AI Personalities**  
- **Resolve conflicts and handle unpredictable AI behaviors.**  
- Some AI **refuse to work together**, others **ignore team decisions**, and some are **stubborn or overly perfectionist**.  
- Your **leadership skills will be tested** as you **motivate teammates and keep the project moving forward.**  

### 🖥 3. **Code & Debug with AI Teammates**  
- AI teammates will **write code for assigned tasks**, but **each AI has a quirk**:  
  - Some introduce **intentional errors** 🐛.  
  - Others write **overcomplicated or cryptic code**.  
- **Your job: Review, debug, and fix their work before merging it into the project.**  
- We’ve built a **custom Git system** to **simulate real-world collaboration**—requiring players to **push, review, and merge responsibly.**  

### 🎤 4. **Pitch & Present Your Project**  
- Just like a real hackathon, you’ll **present your project**, but…  
  - AI teammates **might miscommunicate** 🤦‍♂️.  
  - Some may **answer incorrectly or go off-topic**.  
- Can you **think fast, adapt, and handle AI mishaps under pressure?**  

### 🎓 5. **Learn & Improve with AI-Driven Feedback**  
- At the end of each session, **ManageHack analyzes your decisions** and provides **personalized feedback on leadership, problem-solving, and debugging skills.**  
- Discover your **strengths and areas for improvement**—turning **ManageHack into a powerful learning tool!**

## 🚧 Current Progress & Future Plans  
For this version,because the limit time of the hackathon (only 48 hours), we haven’t implemented all of our planned features yet, but we **hope to continue developing ManageHack in the future**. We believe this project is more than just a game—it has the potential to be a **valuable educational tool** for students to practice **teamwork, leadership, and debugging in a real-world setting.**
